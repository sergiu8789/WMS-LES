#Service section
#
#The service section is used to define how the server is started up when started via rp start on Linux/UNIX platforms. For Windows you must use the services.xml.  See the Developer Guide for more information.
#

[SERVICE]
#
#The command that is ran when the service starts up. To enable full tracing set this to mocaserver -t* -o
#command=mocaserver
#
#The file that standard output is written to that comes from the server. 
#output=%LESDIR%\log\mocaserver.log 

#
#Cluster Section
#
#The cluster section is used to configure the server when deployed in a cluster.
#

[CLUSTER]
#The name of the cluster. Every node in a cluster must use the same name in order to communicate with each other. 
#name=
#
#The name of the JGroups configuration file that must be located in LESDIR/data. 
#jgroups-xml=
#
#Domain name used when setting the domain for the console session cookie. 
#cookie-domain=
#
#Role Manager used to control what node will manage each job and task. Different Role Managers can be defined on each node in the cluster to control what node will manage each job and task; three are provided. These are the valid values: FIXED, PREFERRED (default) and DYNAMIC.
#role-manager=PREFERRED
#
#A comma-separated list of one or more roles of which the Role Manager will use in determining what role(s) a node should assume ownership when it starts. 
#roles=
#
#A comma-separated list of one or more roles of which the Role Manager should never assume ownership when it starts.
#exclude-roles=
#
#The number of seconds that each node will wait between each acquisition of a role. This wait time staggers the assignment of roles, so a single node will not acquire all roles and then lose them as nodes start. 
#role-check-rate=10
#
#The number of thread runners the server will start that can handle incoming asynchronous execution requests. 
#async-runners=10
#
#The maxiumum amount of asynchronous execution requests the node can do at a time. Any attempt to submit more than this number will block the node until a currently submitted request completes. 
#async-submit-cap=10000
#
#The type of protocol used for clustering. These are the valid values: udp or tcp-mcast or tcp-hosts or tcp-db.
#jgroups-protocol=udp
#
#The ip address in which JGroups will bind to. This can be used when a static ip is configured for this adapter.
#jgroups-bind-addr=
#
#The interface in which JGroups will bind to. This is recommended to be used when multiple network adapters are attached to the machine. I.E. eth0
#jgroups-bind-interface=
#
#The port that JGroups will bind to. This value will default to 7800 for tcp-hosts. Others it will use an ephemeral port.
#jgroups-bind-port=
#
#The initial hosts that JGroups should start with in the view when using TCP. This must be set when using tcp-hosts. This should be a comma separated list of hostport (ex. host1[7800],host2[7800])
#jgroups-tcp-hosts=
#
#The option that will enable compression of messages between nodes. To enable, set to true.

#
#The timeout in milliseconds to wait for initial members.
#jgroups-tcp-ping-timeout=5000
#
#The timeout in milliseconds to wait to complete a merge.
#jgroups-merge-timeout=15000
#
#The maximum number of threads that the JGroups timer thread pool is allowed to create.
#jgroups-timer-max-threads=
#
#Removes all process based tasks from the cluster. Disabling process based tasks in the cluster will reduce network traffic and improve cluster stability. If sharing caches between processes is required, then individual process based tasks can be added to the cluster by specifying the JVM argument -Dmoca.cluster=true or reconfiguring the task to thread may work as well. The use cases for cache sharing needs to be determined on a case by case basis, there's is no easy way to determine what process tasks should or should not be clustered.
#exclude-process-tasks=false
#
#The clustering architecture mode for the server. The new "moca" clustering mode is enabled by default because it provides a much more stable cluster. It is possible to switch back to the old "infinispan" mode if any issues are found. Switching back to the old mode is highly discouraged.
#mode=moca
#
#The range of ports from the specified bind-port to the specified bindport + X, where X is the value of tcp-port-range, to which the current host will try to connect if its bind-port is unavailable for a clustering setup using tcp-protocol.
#tcp-port-range=0
#
#The range of ports from the specified bind-port to the specified bindport + X, where X is the value of tcpping-port-range, to which the current host will try to connect if its bind-port is unavailable for a clustering setup using tcpping-protocol.
#tcpping-port-range=0
#
#Timeout setting for a node joining the cluster
#jgroups-join-timeout=
#
#Optional. This is used only by integrator. Sets the type of async execution when customer requires to set the execution mechanism for tasks in integrator. There are three possible settings. 
#    false - setting value to 'false' in the registry will select the cluster async executor
#    true - setting value to 'true' in the registry will select the standard async executor
#integrator-use-local-async-executor=true

#compress-dirs=%LESDIR%\log
#
#The minimum amount of idle native processes that will be maintained in the pool. If the idle and busy amount of processes equals the max then another process will not be spawned. Setting this value to 0 will cause processes to only be created as requested. Setting this value equal to max-pool-size will make sure that the pool always has that many proceses in it.

#
#Maximum number of rows that a query can return. If an SQL query returns more rows than the number specified by query-limit, an exception is thrown and the transaction rolls back. The value of query-limit can be set to a number between 1 and 2,000,000 inclusive. If you set query-limit to a number outside of the valid range of values (for example, 0), the MOCA server will not start and a message will be added to the log stating that the query-limit value is not in the valid range. The maximum valid value of 2,000,000 is set to prevent out of memory errors that might occur on the server if all rows are read into memory.

#Maximum number of rows that can be accumulated when piping together commands in local syntax. This value is used to prevent an excessively large number of rows from being accumulated which could cause performance or memory issues on the server. If the accumulation limit is reached, an exception is thrown.

#Milliseconds to wait for custom support ZIP hooks to finish running. This timeout may be increased if there are custom support ZIP hooks that rely on expensive operations to complete.
#support-zip-timeout=2000
#
#Indicates that MOCA is to delete the expanded web archive files (WARs) that are deployed by Jetty every time the MOCA server is shut down. This action eliminates potential disk space issues, but at the cost of a longer shut down time. The daemon thread that is spawned to delete the expanded WARs takes time and uses resources that cannot be used by other processes while the daemon thread is running. If a shorter shut down time is more important than a potential disk space issue or you have processes in place to delete the WARs, set this key to false.
#clean-war-deploy=true
#
#Required.  Specifies the REFS service URL to facilitate communication between the two systems.
#rpweb-url=
#
#Milliseconds to wait between indexing executions before MOCA reindexes all hibernate tables that have an entity that is annotated with@Index. To disable indexing, do not include this MOCA registry key. If you include this MOCA registry key, but do not specify its value (massÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ËœindexÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Ëœinterval=), indexing starts and stops without performing any indexing, which produces a line in trace files that states that the index is disabled.
#mass-index-interval=
#
#Max time in milliseconds that a call to disable a trace may block while waiting to ensure that all asynchronous log messages have been delivered. This setting should only be increased if the system is very busy, clients are losing messages at the end of a trace, and the log messages are critical to the operation. Increasing the value on a very busy system may introduce blocking for other areas that close traces such as tasks with a log configured. If MOCA detects that trace messages have been lost, it logs an error in the server trace.
#async-trace-close-wait-ms=15000
#
#The default context path for Configurable Web Services. This will determine the prefix for all CWS action paths.
#ws-cws-context=cws
#
#The maximum allowed request size (in kilobytes) before file uploads are refused by the RESTful web service framework.
#ws-max-upload-size-kb=1000
#
#Optional. Defines the base path the system will use for all REST web resource links included in web service responses.  By default, the system creates links using the scheme, host and port of the current request. This approach may not be adequate for customers with sophisticated deployments. This setting provides customers the option to deterministically define the base path to be use instead of mirroring the current request. The base path should contain the scheme, host and port (optional).
#    Example: https://prod.server.corp:8080
#ws-base-url=
#
#Optional. Defines the base path the system will use to expand REST web resource links. This configuration option is only available when ws-base-url is defined. By default, during web service link expansion the system will perform a web service call using the base path defined by ws-base-url. If ws-base-url points to a load balancer or other network appliance it may be preferable for the system to expand links using a different base path (such as localhost) for improved performance.
#    Example: http://localhost:4500
#ws-expansion-url=
#
#Optional. Defines the base path the system will use for the MOCA console.  The MOCA console contains several flows that utilize HTTP redirects (302) which by default are executed using the current requestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scheme, host and port. This setting provides customers the option to define the base path to be use instead of mirroring the current request. The base path should contain the scheme, host and port (optional).
#    Example: https://prod.server.corp:8080
#console-base-url=
#
#Optional. Defines number of threads for accepting native process connections. Higher value improves resilience against non-native process connections, but also uses more resources. Value of 0 forces legacy non-threading behavior. Intended for situations when the box is experiencing a lot of nuisance socket connections, such as caused by running port security scans.
#process-watcher-threads=1
#
#Optional. Timeout when reading process id from new native process connection.
#process-id-timeout-millis=500
#
#Optional. Timeout when waiting to accept new native process connection.
#process-accept-timeout-millis=100
#
#Optional. Specifies the mechanism MOCA will utilize for persisting user authentication sessions. MOCA relies on session persistence to support shared logins across a MOCA cluster. Available configuration options:
#    database - the default. It offers good performance and reliability. Requires MOCA to be configured with a database.
#    infinispan - MOCA will utilize an Infinispan replicated cache to maintain sessions across a cluster. This option offers the best performance and does not require a database but it's less reliable (existing user logins not visible to all nodes of the cluster). Infinispan is the default persistence provider in prior releases (2017.1 and older) but is no longer recommended. The Infinispan option is intended as a fall back if a customer encounters difficulties using the recommended default.
#user-auth-persistence-provider=database
#
#Optional. Specifies how often to schedule a thread that updates last access dates for user sessions. Larger values reduce database activity resulting in better performance, but add a rounding error to the session expiration timeout.
#user-auth-persistence-update-interval-sec=60
#
#Optional. Specifies the threshold for updating last access date for user sessions. If the difference between session last access date and the database value is less than this threshold, then the database record is not updated. Larger threshold values reduce database activity resulting in better performance, but add a rounding error to the session expiration timeout. By default this value is calculated as 1/2*user-auth-persistence-update-interval-sec.
#user-auth-persistence-update-threshold-sec=30
#
#Optional. Specifies which algorithm MOCA uses by default to page SQL queries. Queries that explicitly specify an algorithm will use that algorithm over the one set by this registry setting. Available configuration options:
#    classic - For Oracle database. Uses a sub-query select for the page data.
#    cte - For Oracle database. Uses a common table expression for the main query.
#    over - For Oracle database. Uses analytical count over the whole data set. Note that this algorithm may not be compatible with some types of queries, so great care should be taken before selecting it for a production environment.
#oracle-limit-syntax=cte
#
#Supplemental log file for capturing JDBC activity details
#bind-log=
#
#The default number of records returned in a single page for a CWS endpoint configured for paging. Individual CWS endpoint configurations override this value.
#default-cws-paging-limit=
#
#Optional. Sets the default filtering behavior for the Dlx(Apex) thick client, some screens will not respect this setting due to the performance implications. There are three possible settings.
#    suffix(Default) - setting value to 'suffix' in the registry will add the wildcard * at the end of the string that the user tries to filter. 
#    full - setting value to 'full' in the registry will add the wildcard * at both begining and the end of the string that the user tries to filter. 
#    exact - setting value to 'exact' in the registry will return the same string without adding any wild card to the string the user searches.
#Note : If the value is not set in the registry then from 9.1 till 2019.1 the default value is full , and from 2020.1 it is suffix
#default-apex-filtering-wildcard-behavior=suffix

#Purges the configured war extraction directory of files with the war extraction extension(.dir).
#Note: This should only be enabled on Windows systems where the configured war extraction directory is known and not shared by other resources as this feature may risk deleting them.
#enable-war-extract-dir-purge=false
#
#Read timeout in milliseconds that is passed to the "do http request" MOCA command. This is a global setting for all requests invoked by this MOCA command, but override is possible by passing the readTimeout setting to the command.
#The default setting is 0, which implies no timeout.
#do-http-request-timeout-ms=0
#
#The max resident size a native process is able to take up before it is discarded from the native process pool. Measured in megabytes. The default is 0, which implies no maximum size.
#max-native-process-memory-mb=0
#
#The percentage of maximum physical memory value to check before we spawn a new native process, If the utilized memory on the system is more than the given percentage value then do not allow to spawn new native process. Measured in percentage. The default value is 100, so this is disabled by default.
#Note: If max-physical-memory-percentage=100 then it allows the native processes to spawn new object even though the current physical memory utilized is greater than the default or given percentage value. By enabling this you are allowing the system to use all of the available memory to create new native process objects, System may continue to create the new native process objects untill the native process pool size i.e. max-pool-size is reached and this may cause server to go down.
#max-physical-memory-percentage=100
#
#Additional list of classes from MOCA's core classes which may be considered safe to deserialize from a multi-dimensional array of objects in a client connection's MocaResults
#json-deserializable-classes=

# <alias>=<url>
#
#Examples:
#prod.server.corp:4550=http://prod.server.corp/service
#http://localhost:4500/service=http://prod.server.corp/service
